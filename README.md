# Dabbu Server

A unified API platform to access your emails, photos, and chats as simple files and folders.

## Intro

Tired of having your files and folders randomly scattered about online with multiple companies from Google to Dropbox? Want to access your Google Drive or OneDrive as fast and easily as your hard drive? Well, that's exactly what we have tried doing with Dabbu. We'll let this GIF do the talking:

![](./media/DabbuCLI.gif)

What you just saw there was Dabbu CLI in action - a simple program in javascript that leverages the Dabbu API to bring your files and folders at your fingertips from all over the web.

**This repo contains the server application that handles API calls from clients. The source for the CLI app demoed in the GIF above can be found [here](https://github.com/gamemaker1/dabbu-cli).**

## Getting started

The installation can be done manually on Linux, MacOS, Android (Requires Termux) and Windows.

A detailed installation guide can be found [here](./docs/Installation.md).

Here is a brief install guide:
- Install [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) and [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).
- Then run the following commands in terminal/command prompt:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/gamemaker1/dabbu-server . [Notice the full stop at the end]
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
- Your server is now running! To check, go to http://localhost:8080/. You will see the text `Dabbu Server running on port 8080` on the page. If not, try running the server again or check if you have missed a step. If the problem persists, post a message on [Github discussions](https://github.com/gamemaker1/dabbu-server/discussions/categories/q-a) asking for help. We'll only be glad to help you :)

## Updating the server

To update the server, simply run the following commands from the terminal/command prompt:

```sh
$ git pull origin main
```
